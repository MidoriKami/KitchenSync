KitchenSync is a XivLauncher/Dalamud plugin for FFXIV.

The purpose of this plugin is to give the user more options and control in how the game shows skills that are unavailable due to level sync.

By default the game darkens the color of skills that are not available, but this still makes it difficult to see at a glance what skills you can or can not use.

There are some more features planned, so stay tuned!

KitchenSync lets you set a transparency percentage to fade out those skills instead, making it much more clear that those skills are not available.
